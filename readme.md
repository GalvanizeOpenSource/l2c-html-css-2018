## What is HTML and CSS?

Two of the main building block of the web!

- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

A loose analogy you can think of for the scope of this course:

HTML is sort of like bones. Its the structure of the web page.

CSS is similar to skin. It adds style and changes the appearance of the page. 

JavaScript is like the Muscle. It can change and move elements around on the page(not covered in this workshop). 

Is there a "brain"? Yes! There are many languages that can used to access databases, perform complicated calculations and send/receive information. Some common languages: Javascript, Python, Ruby, PHP.
