## What is HTML and CSS?

Two of the main building block of the web!

- HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

An analogy you can think of for the scope of this workshop:

HTML is sort of like bones. Its the structure of the web page.

CSS is similar to skin. It adds style and changes the appearance of the page. 

JavaScript is like the Muscle. It can change and move elements around on the page(not covered in this workshop). 

Is there a "brain"? Yes! There are many languages that can used to access databases, perform complicated calculations and send/receive information. Some common languages: Javascript, Python, Ruby, PHP. 


## HTML Basics

###### Some common Tags(Elements):

- `<html>`	designates an HTML document
- `<head>`	contains undisplayed information about the document
- `<title>`	Creates a title for the document
- `<body>`	contains displayed information
- `<header>, <main>, <footer>` denotes which part of the page elements belong

- `<h1> - <h6>` create section headings (h1 biggest, h6 Smallest)
- `<p>` creates paragraphs
- `<a href=""></a>` (anchor), activates a link in the page
- `<ul>, <ol>` creates lists
  - `<li>` contains items in lists
- `<br>`	Inserts a single line break
- `<hr>`	Defines a thematic change in the content

###### Self-closing Tags:
most HTML tags require an opening and a closing tag. There are a few however that do not:

- `<img src="">` creates an image in the page
- `<br>` creates a break in the content
- `<input type="">` creates an input field

## CSS Basics


###### CSS Examples:

this example targets an element `h1` and changes the font size, font weight, and color. 

```
h1 {
    font-size: 24px;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #000000;
}
```
This example targets a class `btn` to change the background color and add padding

```
.btn {
  background: #829aa8;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
